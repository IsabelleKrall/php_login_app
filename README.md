# php_login_app
This is a VERY simple PHP login app for educational purposes only.
This app should under no circumstances be run on a public host un-modified due to beeing too insecure.

Note that the user-information is available for anyone with access to the application.
Once again, this app is only for educational purposes! **do not write any sensible passwords into the password field!**
